# Setup Notes - Scirius IDS Platform

1. Cloned Scirius repository and installed dependencies.
2. Started Docker containers using docker compose.
3. Encountered PostgreSQL version conflict — resolved by disabling Suricata service.
4. Verified services: Elasticsearch, Kibana, RabbitMQ, Fluentd, etc.
5. Created GitHub repository for submission.

## Commands Used
sudo docker compose up -d
sudo docker compose ps
sudo docker compose logs db

## Observations
- Elasticsearch and Kibana started successfully.
- Suricata service was disabled to resolve dependency issues.
- PostgreSQL required manual adjustment due to version mismatch (v18+).
- Final verification done via `docker compose ps`.
